Purpose of this branch is to introduce code to parse TCGA-style sample information.
It also generates catalog v2 and v3 in a step which is separate from discovery per se
Using python-based approach.
See development work katmai:/diskmnt/Projects/cptac_scratch/CPTAC3.workflow/discover/20220105.GDAC_test
and shiso:/Users/mwyczalk/Projects/CPTAC3/Discovery/dev.TCGA

This branch will be moved to master once catalog2 is implemented
